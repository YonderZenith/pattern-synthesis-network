# Distributed Pattern Synthesis Network

**Œò(N¬≤) Intelligence Scaling for Distributed AI Systems**

## Overview

Implementation of the mathematical framework described in:

**"Quadratic Scaling of Distributed Intelligence Through Decentralized Pattern Synthesis"**  
Christopher Thomas Trevethan  
bioRxiv: [DOI pending] (2024)

Distributed intelligence networks where N agents sharing semantic embeddings create **N(N-1)/2** unique pattern synthesis opportunities with only **O(N log N)** communication per node via DHT routing.

## Status

üöß **Under active development** - Reference implementation coming soon

## Applications

The framework is domain-agnostic and applies to any distributed system sharing patterns:

- **Healthcare**: Real-time treatment optimization, medical research
- **Agriculture**: Precision farming, crop optimization
- **Industrial IoT**: Manufacturing, supply chain, predictive maintenance
- **Finance**: Risk modeling, fraud detection, market analysis
- **Smart Cities**: Traffic, energy, environmental monitoring
- **Telecommunications**: Network optimization, resource allocation
- **Scientific Research**: Distributed sensors, collaborative analysis
- **And any other domain with distributed data sources**

## Key Results

- **Œò(N¬≤) intelligence scaling** with O(N log N) communication per node
- **1,000-node simulation** validates theoretical predictions (R¬≤=0.9997)
- **Medical simulation**: 47 treatment optimizations discovered in synthetic 1,000-patient network
